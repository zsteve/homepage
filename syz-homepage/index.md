<p>I am a PhD student in the <a href=https://www.theosysbio.com/>Theoretical Systems Biology</a> group and <a href=https://ms.unimelb.edu.au>School of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at the University of Melbourne. Previously, I finished a MSc at the <a href=https://math.ubc.ca>Department of Mathematics</a> at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>My general interest is in developing mathematical and computational tools for biological inverse problems, at the intersection of dynamical systems, optimization, and statistics.</p>
