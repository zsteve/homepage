title: About me
---

I am currently a MSc student in [Geoffrey Schiebingerâ€™s group](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~geoff/) within the [Institute of Applied Mathematics](https://www.iam.ubc.ca/) and [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. 

Generally speaking, my research interests focus on the application of mathematical and computational tools to problems in systems biology and biophysics. In particular, I am interested in stochastic modelling and inference for inverse problems in biology. You can find me on Twitter as [@_zsteve](https://twitter.com/_zsteve)!

## Software
- [**StationaryOT**](https://github.com/zsteve/StationaryOT), a package applying optimal transport to infer trajectories from stationary single-cell snapshot data. Accompanies the paper _Optimal transport analysis reveals trajectories in steady-state systems_. 
- [**gWOT**](https://github.com/zsteve/gWOT/), an implementation of Global Waddington-OT, a computational method for estimating laws on paths for diffusion-drift developmental processes from sparse time-course data. Accompanies the paper _Towards a mathematical theory of trajectory inference_.
- I wrote a Julia package [OptimalTransport.jl](https://github.com/zsteve/OptimalTransport.jl) implementing various algorithms for computational optimal transport.
