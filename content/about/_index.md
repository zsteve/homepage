title: About me
---

I am currently a MSc student in [Geoffrey Schiebingerâ€™s group](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~geoff/) within the [Institute of Applied Mathematics](https://www.iam.ubc.ca/) and [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. 

Generally speaking, my research interests focus on the application of mathematical and computational tools to problems in systems biology and biophysics. In particular, I am interested in stochastic modelling and inference for inverse problems in biology.

## Education
- MSc (Applied Mathematics) \
    **University of British Columbia** (2019-Present)

- BSc (Applied Mathematics, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology) \
    **University of Melbourne** (2016-2019)

## Publications
- Zhang, S., Chong, A. and Hughes, B.D., 2019. Persistent exclusion processes: Inertia, drift, mixing, and correlation. Physical Review E, 100(4), p.042415.

## Software
- I wrote a Julia package [OptimalTransport.jl](https://github.com/zsteve/OptimalTransport.jl) implementing various algorithms for computational optimal transport.
